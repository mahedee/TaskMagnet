Certainly, if you want to establish a many-to-many relationship between users and roles, you would need a junction table to represent this relationship. Here's the updated schema to reflect a many-to-many relationship between users and roles:

```plaintext
Table: User
- UserID (Primary Key)
- Username
- Password (Hashed)

Table: Task
- TaskID (Primary Key)
- Title
- Description
- DueDate
- Priority
- StatusID (Foreign Key, references TaskStatus.StatusID)
- CategoryID (Foreign Key, references TaskCategory.CategoryID)
- AssigneeID (Foreign Key, references User.UserID)
- CreatorID (Foreign Key, references User.UserID)
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

Table: TaskCategory
- CategoryID (Primary Key)
- CategoryName

Table: TaskStatus
- StatusID (Primary Key)
- StatusName

Table: Comment
- CommentID (Primary Key)
- TaskID (Foreign Key, references Task.TaskID)
- UserID (Foreign Key, references User.UserID)
- CommentText
- CreatedAt

Table: Attachment
- AttachmentID (Primary Key)
- TaskID (Foreign Key, references Task.TaskID)
- UserID (Foreign Key, references User.UserID)
- FileName
- FilePath
- CreatedAt

Table: Role
- RoleID (Primary Key)
- RoleName

Table: UserRole
- UserRoleID (Primary Key)
- UserID (Foreign Key, references User.UserID)
- RoleID (Foreign Key, references Role.RoleID)
```

Explanation:

- The `Role` table is added to store different roles.
- The `UserRole` table serves as a junction table to establish a many-to-many relationship between users and roles.
- The `UserRole` table includes `UserID` and `RoleID` foreign keys referencing the `User` and `Role` tables, respectively.

Now, a user can have multiple roles, and a role can be assigned to multiple users. This allows for more flexibility in managing user roles in your Task Management System. Adjust the schema based on your specific needs and requirements.
